# VIRTUOSO | A 33-Key Rhythm Game

**VIRTUOSO** is currently an experimental **33-Key Rhythm Game** that utilizes most of your keyboard instead of your typical 4/7-keys VSRG games. It features **DryWetMidi** library which can read a MIDI file and convert it into beatmap while also remaps all 88 keys on the MIDI file into the 33 keys assigned.
