Virtuoso is currently an experimental **66-Keys Rhythm Game** that utilizes most of your keyboard instead of your typical 4/7-keys VSRG games. It features DryWetMidi library which can read a MIDI file and convert it into beatmaps while also remaps all 88 keys on the MIDI file into the 66 keys assigned.
